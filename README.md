## 🧹 Contracts

| Contract           | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RankingList`      | Main contract with logic for speed logging, ranking, NFT minting, and fee handling |

## 💡 How It Works

1. User plays the game and sees their reaction time.
2. If they want a medal, they call `mintWithSpeed(speed)` with a `0.01 LYX` fee.
3. The contract logs their time, checks their rank, and:

   * Mints a **Gold** medal for 1st place
   * Mints a **Silver** medal for 2nd place
   * Mints a **Bronze** medal for all other entries
4. Their score is added to the **top 10 leaderboard**.
5. The fee is forwarded to the contract owner.

## 🧪 Usage (Sample Call)

```solidity
rankingList.mintWithSpeed{value: 0.01 ether}(reactionTime);
```

* `reactionTime` is an integer representing milliseconds (e.g., `123` for 123ms).
